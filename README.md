# lets-play-trivia

This Google Apps script will create resources to facilitate a virtual Team Trivia game:

1. An answer form to be used by the participants.
2. A spreadsheet of the submitted answers. This Sheet has a column where you can score each answer, and it has a tab where you can see an up-to-date scoreboard for all teams. 
3. A spreadsheet for you to populate with questions as the game progresses.

Additionally, an HTML file is created from a template that provides instructions and links for the players and quizmaster (see example.jpg).

You can simply point your browser here to create the necessary files, but you'll need to bypass the safety warnings:
